# Memory Game Project
This game was built as a required project for Udacity's Front-End Developer Nanodegree. It requires a fundamental understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Functionality

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
